Please when making a pull request:

- check you code has been go formatted with 'go fmt'.
- ensure you've added an integration test (cucumber under internal/features) or a unit test.
- check the unit tests pass (make test).

cli53 has very good existing test coverage, so I'm unlikely to accept a pull request without
a test, but please do ping me if you're struggling to add a test case and I'll help!
